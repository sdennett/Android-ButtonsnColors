/**
* ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE
*   Goal: Become familiar with use of Buttons and how to dynamically
*         update the color of elements within a Android xml Layout.
*         Layouts can be declared in two ways; 1) by declaring UI elements
*         in XML or 2) Instantiate layout elements at runtime. In this demo
*         I do both by first declaring the layout in XML and the updating
*         elements at runtime. This was a fun learning exercise and I hope
*         this might be of help to others.
